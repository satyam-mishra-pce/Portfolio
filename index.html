                                Hello there! I'm Satyam, a passionate Front-End Web Developer and UI Designer. Welcome to my portfolio, where I bring together the best of both worlds to craft engaging digital experiences.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                With a keen eye for aesthetics and a love for clean code, I'm dedicated to shaping the online landscape with visually striking and highly functional websites. My journey into the world of web development began with a fascination for how technology could bring ideas to life and connect people across the globe.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As a UI designer, I believe that great design is not just about appearances but also about creating intuitive and seamless user experiences. I enjoy delving into the minds of users, understanding their needs, and translating those insights into delightful interfaces that leave a lasting impression.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Having worked on a diverse range of projects, I've honed my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various front-end frameworks. I thrive on the challenge of transforming complex concepts into elegant, responsive designs that adapt beautifully across all devices.

                            <h2>Stage 1</h2>
                            <p>
                                My journey with computers began when I was 11 years old. Back then, there was no internet connection, so I spent most of my time exploring MS Paint and MS Powerpoint. These tools sparked my creativity and inspired me to express myself visually. At school, I learned QBasic, a simple but powerful programming language that fascinated me with its logic and possibilities. I still remember the thrill of writing my first program to check if a person is an adult. That day, I realized that I wanted to create something that the world would use and benefit from in the future.
                            </p>
                            <h2>Stage 2</h2>
                            <p>
                                However, I soon realized that command line programs were not enough for me. I wanted to create applications with graphical user interfaces, like the ones I used on my computer. But I didn’t know how to do that, and the lack of internet made it harder to find out. When I was 14, I came across a book on “Microsoft Visual Basic” that belonged to one of my seniors. The book showed me how to create UI applications, and I was hooked. I borrowed the book for a few days and learned the basics of Visual Basic. Then, over the next few years, I borrowed many more books from libraries (some of them were meant for students five grades above me) and created my own notepad app.
                            </p>
                            <h2>Stage 3</h2>
                            <p>
                                But then, I discovered that the books I had been reading were outdated, and some of the statements and commands no longer worked with the software. That’s when I switched to Java Swing API, a more reliable and future-proof way to create UI apps. I mastered it and created another notepad from scratch, but with more features. Visual Basic and Netbeans both fueled my passion for UI design.
                                <br>
                                This was also the time, when I created hundreds of smartphone UI on paper, because phones were trending those days.
                            </p>
                            <h2>Stage 4</h2>
                            <p>
                                Another thing that amazed me was the ability to create my own websites without installing any software on my computer. This drew me to HTML those days, on which I had a strong grasp in a few weeks. But I was exposed to CSS and JS (when I was 18 years old) during the COVID-19 pandemic, when internet access became more widespread. I created hundreds of projects using HTML, CSS and Javascript. I also got to know about Figma, an year later and gradually started using Figma. Photoshop, Illustrator, and Figma, I found all of them familiar, and hence self learnt them easily just by using them.
                            </p>
                            <h2>Stage 5</h2>
                            <p>
                                During my graduation, I gradually had my hands on Data Structures and Algorithms, with a LeetCode Rating of 1836 one day, and used ReactJS as well for some projects.
